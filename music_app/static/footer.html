        <h3>NOTE</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Dopify Django website made by Varun Dubey, Varun Vijay and Tejas Bhardwaj for our Web Development with Python (Backend) project given to us by our respected teacher Dr. Farhana Desai. All the images of singers, albums or
            movies are taken from google searches and 
            All the songs are collected from different websites. (sorry for piracy hater, but none of use 3 have soptify premium that we could use to download songs and add to this databse.)
            When the project came out, we were crystal clear that weare going to build a Music Streaming site, but did not now it was going to be this difficult.....
            All the singers, music composers and actors are being rquested in the spotify search engine by soptify API and the Python Spotify library (pip install spotipy)
            This project took almost 1 and half month, many turns, frustration and every horror a dev may expect especially during our time, like in college, while coping with other college work, but we are very happy with the final output after many nights not sleeping but coding.
